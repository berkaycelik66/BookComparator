# BookComparator

- Design a class called Book.

- Inherit from this class Comparable interface and override the "compareTo" method.

- Inside this method, write the code that sorts the book by name from A to Z.

- Create 4 objects of this class and store the objects in a Set type structure.

- Then use a Set type data structure a second time and have it sort the books by page count.
